Ocean research encompasses a wide range of scientific investigations and studies aimed at understanding various aspects of the world's oceans. Researchers explore everything from marine biology and ecology to oceanography, climate change impacts, and the dynamics of ocean currents.
Here are some key areas of ocean research. 

1. Oceanography - 
Physical oceanography : examining the physical properties of the ocean, including temperature, salinity, and currents.
Chemical oceanography : investigating the composition of seawater, nutrient cycling, and chemical processes within the ocean.
Biological oceanogaphy : studying marine life, from microscopic organisms to large marine mammals, and their ecological interactions. 

2. Climate change and ocean acidification - 
Researching the impacts of climate change on the ocean, including rising sea levels, changes in temperature, and ocean acidification. This research helps understand the consequences for marine ecosystems and global climate systems.

3. Marine biology and biodiversity - 
Exploring the diverse life forms in the ocean, including coral reefs, deep-sea ecosystems, and coastal habitats. Researchers study marine species, their behaviors, and their roles in maintaining ecosystem health.

4 Deep-sea exploration - 
Investigating the largely unexplored depths of the ocean through submersibles, remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles. Discoveries in the deep sea contribute to our understanding of uniuqe ecosystem and new species.
